#The digital factory relies on the development of advanced integrated analysis and simulation capabilities that better utilize the vast amounts of data produced by production systems. This paper discusses the integration of data-driven and simulation models in the context of a partially automated aircraft assembly process, with the goal to analyze and assess the impact of disruptions on the production system and identify strategies to best recover from these disruptions.
