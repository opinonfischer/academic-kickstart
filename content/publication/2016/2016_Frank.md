#A design methodology is presented that supports the design of future aerospace rocket-powered vehicles. In particular, it provides the capabilities to rapidly evaluate the performance, weight, size, and lifecycle costs of all chemical rocket engines at a conceptual level. By leveraging cycle-based approaches and surrogate modeling techniques, the performance of all chemical rocket engines can be evaluated with an accuracy of 3%, whereas it divides the execution time by a factor of 105 compared to current physics-based models. New mass-estimating relationships are developed for estimating the weight and the size of solid engines with an improved accuracy compared to existing models. Physics-based models built around the key design drivers are used for the weight and size estimation of liquid and hybrid engines. Although existing cost-estimating relationships are used to evaluate the lifecycle costs of solid and liquid engines, a more physics-based model is developed for hybrid engines. Although it supports complex multiobjective optimizations and rapid trade-off analyses, this environment is also the first of its sort able to estimate the lifecycle costs of hybrid rocket engines.
