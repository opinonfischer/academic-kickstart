abstract = "Over the last decades, aircraft have evolved into large-scale products characterized by an increasing number of complex systems, components, parts, and functionalities. Each of them involves different disciplines and technologies, along with different sets of tools, processes, and methods. Hence, the successful definition, design, and development of an aircraft require a holistic and systematic approach to aircraft design that supports the development of a life cycle balanced system solution that meets customer requirements. The field of systems engineering provides an interdisciplinary structured yet flexible process to help address these aspects. This chapter illustrates systems engineering principles, process, and methods in the context of aircraft design. It first defines the concept of a system and discusses the importance of the life cycle in the creation of competitive and cost effective products. This chapter then introduces systems engineering through a series of definitions and further presents an example of a system engineering process model. Finally, it illustrates the systems engineering process as is implemented in aircraft design. Keywords: advanced design methods; aircraft conceptual design; design process; design space exploration; functional analysis; requirement analysis; systems design; systems engineering system life cycle."
